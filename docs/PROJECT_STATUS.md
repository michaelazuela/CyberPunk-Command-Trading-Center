# Project Status

## Latest Change

Date: 2026-06-05
Task: Add Quant Desk Local Supervisor operational Discord notifications.
Files changed: QuantDeskSupervisorTray.ps1, docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md, package.json, tools/supervisor/index.ts, tools/supervisor/notifications.ts, tools/supervisor/supervisor.test.ts.
Reason: Notify Discord for operational health events only: scanner/recorder down or recovered, bridge unreachable or recovered, stale 5M bars with cooldown, owned child restarts, and tray supervisor self-heal events. Suppress routine healthy pings and preserve trade-alert boundaries.
Tests run: PowerShell tray syntax parse; npx tsx tools/supervisor/supervisor.test.ts; npx tsc --noEmit; npm run test; npm run lint; npm run build; npm run guard:no-firebase; npm run guard:legacy-rules; npm run guard:architecture; npm run guard:schema; git diff --check; live supervisor reload.
Result: Passed. Supervisor monitor sends transition-based operational Discord notifications when a health webhook is configured. Live reload sent one stale-5M operational notification and wrote cooldown state to logs/supervisor/supervisor-notifications-state.json. Tray self-heal can fire an explicit supervisor self-heal notification command.
Trading logic changed: No.
Bridge impact: None. Bridge scripts and bridge behavior were not modified.
Journal/RAG impact: None.
Supabase impact: None.
Known risks: Notifications depend on a configured health/scanner webhook. Stale 5M alerts are cooldown-limited, not market-session-aware beyond the status payload. Manual duplicate processes are still reported, not adopted.
Next recommended action: Leave Discord notifications on for operational alerts and confirm away-from-home pings are useful without becoming noisy.

Task: Add scanner decision event tape and make missed-trade classification proof-based.
Files changed: docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md, src/agents/scannerPlanSelectionAgent.ts/tests, src/lib/localScannerEngine.ts/tests, tools/automation/nt-scanner.ts/tests.
Reason: Prevent early-move context from being reported as a missed trade unless a valid app-owned executable/conditional candidate existed first, and preserve a per-5M scanner decision audit trail for suppressed/live decisions.
Tests run: npx tsx src/agents/scannerPlanSelectionAgent.test.ts; npx tsx src/lib/localScannerEngine.test.ts; npx tsx tools/automation/nt-scanner-alert.test.ts; npm run nt:scanner -- --instrument MES --bridge-instrument MES --bridge-url http://127.0.0.1:8765 --poll-seconds 60 --bar-time-zone eastern --once --dry-run; npx tsc --noEmit; npm run test; npm run lint; npm run build; npm run guard:no-firebase; npm run guard:legacy-rules; npm run guard:architecture; npm run guard:schema; npm run guard:active-windows.
Result: Passed. Current dry-run writes scanner-decision-tape-YYYY-MM-DD-SYMBOL-session.json and reports TriggerPending/context when no valid candidate proof exists.
Trading logic changed: Yes, limited to scanner alert-state classification: early-move context without a valid app-owned candidate is no longer labeled Missed. Entry, stop, target, risk, setup approval, session windows, Discord delivery, RAG, bridge behavior, and canExecute gates are unchanged.
Bridge impact: None. The event tape records existing OHLC-derived facts and history coverage; it does not alter bridge reads.
Journal/RAG impact: None. Decision tape is local audit JSON only.
Supabase impact: None.
Known risks: Existing historical watchlist artifacts generated before this change may still contain stale/confusing advisory language. Decision tape starts from new scanner cycles going forward.
Next recommended action: Keep scanner running through the active session and review the decision tape if a setup is suppressed or appears missed.

Task: Enforce 30-day scanner history preload with cache-first bridge self-healing.
Files changed: AGENTS.md, docs/CODEX_RULES.md, docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md, src/lib/gemini.ts, src/lib/htfLiquidityDrawEngine.ts/tests, tools/automation/nt-scanner.ts/tests, diagnostic replay and HTF/MSS regression fixtures.
Reason: Prevent the scanner or diagnostic replay from treating thin higher-timeframe context as a normal market-structure read when 30 days of structured OHLC history should be available.
Tests run: npx tsc --noEmit; npx tsx tools/automation/nt-scanner-alert.test.ts; npx tsx src/lib/htfLiquidityDrawEngine.test.ts; npx tsx tools/automation/htf-mss-june-1-regression.test.ts; npx tsx tools/automation/htf-mss-phase-5b-regression.test.ts; npx tsx tools/automation/htf-mss-actual-ohlc-replay.test.ts; npm run test; npm run lint; npm run build; npm run guard:no-firebase; npm run guard:legacy-rules; npm run guard:architecture; npm run guard:schema; npm run guard:active-windows; git diff --check; npm run nt:scanner -- --instrument MES --bridge-instrument MES --once --dry-run --discord false.
Result: Passed. Scanner smoke was healthy; market-map refresh was skipped because the existing scanner state marked the map fresh.
Trading logic changed: No. Data sufficiency requirements and diagnostics were strengthened; entry, stop, target, risk, session, setup approval, and canExecute gates were not changed.
Bridge impact: Scanner now reads 30 calendar days from durable market_bars first and attempts NinjaTrader historical-bars repair/backfill when coverage is incomplete.
Journal/RAG impact: None expected.
Supabase impact: Existing market_bars cache may receive repaired bars through the existing upsert path.
Known risks: Build still reports pre-existing Vite chunk/dynamic-import warnings. Live self-healing depends on NinjaTrader bridge historical-bars returning the requested range.
Next recommended action: Restart scanner services and confirm a fresh market-map refresh logs 30-day coverage for 5M/15M/60M/240M.

Date: 2026-06-01
Task: Add HTF context sufficiency visibility and data-limited wording enforcement.
Files changed: AGENTS.md, docs/CODEX_RULES.md, docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md, src/lib/gemini.ts, src/lib/htfLiquidityDrawEngine.ts/tests, HTF/MSS replay/regression report renderers/tests, Discord compact alert formatter/tests.
Reason: Make every HTF/MSS-facing output show sufficiency, reliability, loaded timeframe coverage, minimum expected context, blockers, HTF usage, and candidate-promotion boundary.
Tests run: npx tsc --noEmit; npx tsx src/lib/htfLiquidityDrawEngine.test.ts; npx tsx tools/automation/htf-mss-actual-ohlc-replay.test.ts; npx tsx tools/automation/htf-mss-actual-ohlc-replay.ts --pretty; npx tsx tools/automation/htf-mss-june-1-regression.test.ts; npx tsx tools/automation/htf-mss-june-1-regression.ts; npx tsx tools/automation/htf-mss-phase-5b-regression.test.ts; npx tsx tools/automation/htf-mss-phase-5b-regression.ts; npx tsx tools/automation/discord-alert-format.test.ts; npx tsx src/lib/geminiPromptSafety.test.ts; npm run test; npm run lint; npm run build; npm run guard:no-firebase; npm run guard:legacy-rules; npm run guard:architecture; npm run guard:schema; npm run guard:active-windows; git diff --check.
Result: Passed.
Trading logic changed: No.
Bridge impact: None expected. Existing structured coverage is displayed more clearly.
Journal/RAG impact: None expected.
Supabase impact: None.
Known risks: Build still reports pre-existing Vite chunk/dynamic-import warnings.
Next recommended action: Review live scanner/Discord output after deployment to confirm the compact HTF Context section is readable in production Discord cards.

## Previous Change

Date: 2026-06-01
Task: Add HTF context sufficiency rule and data-limited classification diagnostics.
Files changed: AGENTS.md, docs/CODEX_RULES.md, docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md, src/types.ts, src/lib/gemini.ts, src/lib/htfLiquidityDrawEngine.ts/tests, bridge diagnostic replay typing, HTF/MSS replay/regression tooling and tests.
Reason: Prevent thin higher-timeframe history from being treated as proof of structural conflict or absence of setup while preserving deterministic execution gates.
Tests run: npx tsc --noEmit; npx tsx tools/automation/htf-mss-actual-ohlc-replay.test.ts; npx tsx tools/automation/htf-mss-actual-ohlc-replay.ts; npx tsx tools/automation/htf-mss-june-1-regression.test.ts; npx tsx tools/automation/htf-mss-phase-5b-regression.test.ts; npm run test; npm run lint; npm run build; npm run guard:no-firebase; npm run guard:legacy-rules; npm run guard:architecture; npm run guard:schema; npm run guard:active-windows; git diff --check.
Result: Passed.
Trading logic changed: Yes, limited to HTF/MSS classification reliability and candidate-promotion blocking when HTF context is data-limited.
Bridge impact: Replay/diagnostic reports now expose exact timeframe coverage and sufficiency status. Bridge contract and live bridge behavior unchanged.
Journal/RAG impact: None.
Supabase impact: None.
Known risks: Needs broader live-history observation across more sessions after deployment.
Next recommended action: Review generated HTF/MSS replay diagnostics for sufficient/data-limited classification before using any HTF conclusion.

Task: Harden Discord research interaction safety handling for legacy review packs.
Files changed: research Discord interaction agent/tests, research Discord interaction automation server wrapper, project status.
Reason: Prevent crashes when legacy research samples omit `advisoryOnly` while still rejecting explicit unsafe/executable fields.
Tests run: git diff --check; npx tsc --noEmit; npm run test; npm run lint; npm run build; npm run guard:no-firebase; npm run guard:legacy-rules; npm run guard:architecture; npm run guard:schema; isolated same-sample simulation.
Result: Passed.
Trading logic changed: No.
Bridge impact: None.
Journal/RAG impact: None.
Supabase impact: None.
Known risks: Build still reports pre-existing chunk-size/dynamic-import warnings.
Next recommended action: Restart the local interaction server and retry the Discord button click through the Cloudflare Tunnel.

## Previous Change

Date: 2026-05-29
Task: Add Discord research review interaction handler.
Files changed: research Discord interaction agent/tests, research Discord interaction automation CLI/server, research review state typing, package script wiring, environment example.
Reason: Allow research review Discord button clicks to update reviewed copies of sample review packs while preserving advisory-only boundaries.
Tests run: git diff --check; npx tsc --noEmit; npm run test; npm run lint; npm run build; npm run guard:no-firebase; npm run guard:legacy-rules; npm run guard:architecture; npm run guard:schema.
Result: Passed.
Trading logic changed: No.
Bridge impact: None.
Journal/RAG impact: None.
Supabase impact: None.
Known risks: Real Discord endpoint still requires public URL routing plus Discord application configuration; build still reports pre-existing chunk-size/dynamic-import warnings.
Next recommended action: Configure research-only Discord interaction secrets and test with `npm run research:discord-interactions -- --simulate ... --pretty` before exposing the HTTP endpoint.

Date: 2026-05-29
Task: Add research hypothetical outcome overlay for Discord review cards.
Files changed: research hypothetical overlay agent/tests, research outcome math report wiring, Discord research review card copy, research outcome CLI summary, package test wiring.
Reason: Show neutral research-only reference, favorable thresholds, adverse invalidation reference, first resolved event, and hypothetical outcome label for candidate review.
Tests run: git diff --check; npx tsc --noEmit; npm run test; npm run lint; npm run build; npm run guard:no-firebase; npm run guard:legacy-rules; npm run guard:architecture; npm run guard:schema; research outcome math sample run; research Discord dry-run.
Result: Passed.
Trading logic changed: No.
Bridge impact: None.
Journal/RAG impact: None.
Supabase impact: None.
Known risks: Build still reports pre-existing chunk-size/dynamic-import warnings.
